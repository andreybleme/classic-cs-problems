# classic-cs-problems
My solutions and notes on classic computer science problems, mostly implemented using javascript and python

Some of these problems were discussed on the [Classic computer science problems in python](https://amzn.to/34zdSbm) book, some were gathered on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) portal.

This repository contains implementations and some personal notes that I took while learning :)
