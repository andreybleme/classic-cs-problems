Linear seaches are O(n), given n the total number of elements.

Binary searches are O(log n), since the space of search are half the size compared to the linear search.
Binary searches though require the collection to be sorted. Keep in mind that the best sort algorithms take O (n log n) time.

It may worth to perform binary searches if you would need to search a lot of times at a same collection.
