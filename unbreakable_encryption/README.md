### NOTES:

One-time-pad constraints:
- Dummy data should be equal sized as the original data
- Dummy should be really random
- Dummy data generated should be secret

Uses XOR operation to blend dummy (random) data with the original data.
The reason for using XOR is:
A ^ B = C
C ^ B = A
C ^ A = B

So the generated keypair is = dummy, encrypted
To decrypt we just re-combine the key pair generated by the `encrypt()`.
